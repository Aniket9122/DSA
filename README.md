# Practice-DSA-in-C++

This repository is **my personal playground for sharpening data-structures-and-algorithms (DSA) skills** with modern C++.  
Nothing fancy‚Äîjust a growing collection of solved problems, small experiments, and reference implementations that help me keep my fundamentals sharp.

## What you‚Äôll find here

- üóÇÔ∏è **Problem-wise folders** (e.g. `arrays/`, `graphs/`, `dp/`) each containing:
  - One or more C++ source files (`.cpp`)
  - A brief `README.md` or comment header describing the problem
- üìù **Notes**: When a concept trips me up, I drop a short markdown note alongside the code.

## Why this repo exists

I solve a lot of practice problems on sites such as LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank.  
Instead of letting solutions languish in the platform IDEs, I commit them here so I can:

1. Track my progress over time  
2. Refactor and benchmark with real build tools  
3. Revisit tricky patterns when preparing for interviews
